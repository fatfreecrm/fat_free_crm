## Installation

Please view one of the following installation guides:

### [Setup Linux or Mac OS](http://guides.fatfreecrm.com/Setup-Linux-or-Mac-OS)

Installing Fat Free CRM on Linux or Mac OS X

### [Setup Heroku](http://guides.fatfreecrm.com/Setup-Heroku)

Setting up a Heroku instance for Fat Free CRM

### [Setup Microsoft Windows](http://guides.fatfreecrm.com/Setup-Microsoft-Windows)

### [Running Fat Free CRM as a Rails Engine](http://guides.fatfreecrm.com/Running-as-a-Rails-Engine)

Run the Fat Free CRM gem within a separate Rails application.
This is the best way to deploy Fat Free CRM if you need to add plugins or make any customizations. Note that it is not yet simple to 'bolt' Fat Free CRM into your existing rails project, but we're heading in that direction.

## For Developers

Fat Free CRM is released under the MIT license and is freely available for you to use for your own purposes. We do encourage contributions to make Fat Free CRM even better. Send us a pull-request and we'll do our best to accommodate your needs.

Specific features that are not 'Fat Free' in nature, can be added by creating Rails Engines. See the [wiki](http://github.com/fatfreecrm/fat_free_crm/wiki) for information on how to do this.

Tests can easily be run by typing 'rake' but please note that they do take a while to run! Alternatively, you can see the test build status over at our [travis page](http://travis-ci.org/fatfreecrm/fat_free_crm)
