# Project Agents.md Guide for OpenAI Codex

This Agents.md file provides comprehensive guidance for OpenAI Codex and other AI agents working with this codebase.

## Project Structure

This project follows a standard Ruby on Rails application structure

- `/app`: Source code that OpenAI Codex should analyze
  - `/assets`: CSS and Javascript components
  - `/controllers`: Controllers
  - `/views`: Views written in ERB
  - `/models`: ActiveRecord models 
- `/public`: Static assets (OpenAI Codex should not modify these directly)
- `/spec`: Test files that OpenAI Codex should maintain and extend

## Installation

- Install a version of ruby as per .ruby-version
- Install a current version of sqlite
- Create a config/database.yml with the relevant database connection details, for the development and test environments, based on the config/database.sqlite.yml example.
- Create the development and test databases
- Run `bundle exec rake db:migrate RAILS_ENV=test` to validate the database configuration is correct.

## Coding Conventions

### General Conventions for Agents.md Implementation

- OpenAI Codex should follow the existing code style in each file
- Agents.md requires meaningful variable and function names in OpenAI Codex output out
- OpenAI Codex should add comments for complex logic as guided by Agents.md
