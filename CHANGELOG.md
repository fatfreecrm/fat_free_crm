### Important changes

#### Fixed XSS flaw in tags_helper
Credit Antonin Steinhauser (asteinhauser) for discovery and responsible disclosure.

#### Devise replaces Authlogic for user authentication
Ticket #742 replaces Authlogic with the latest Devise (4.3.0) which has wider adoption.
This change requires a database migration on the User model. Please note:
 - Most User fields are renamed and can hence be rolled back. Existing Authlogic passwords will continue to work.
 - Users will be forced logged out. Existing user sessions will not be kept and the fields `persistence_token, single_access_token, perishable_token` will be dropped from the database.
 - Though the migration is generally safe **we recommend to make a backup of your database** before migrating.

#### Existing OAuth broken
The Devise change will break any OAuth login plugins which depend on Authlogic.
You can [configure OAuth for Devise using the guides here](https://github.com/plataformatec/devise/wiki/omniauth:-overview).

#### Login and user-related routes changed
The login URL routes have been changed to use the defaults of Devise.

#### User mailers changed
Mailers related to user password reset, etc. are changed to use the defaults of Devise.

#### PaperClip version updated from 5.2.1 to 6.0.0
PaperClip now only depends on `aws-sdk-s3` instead of `aws-sdk`. For more info see https://github.com/thoughtbot/paperclip/pull/2481.
Replace the Cocaine gem with Terrapin. https://github.com/thoughtbot/terrapin/ Apart from the namespace change, this is a drop in replacement.

#### Rails 5.2
The underlying framework is now rails 5.2.*

#### Ruby 2.4 deprecated
Ruby 2.4 has reached end of life and is no longer activity tested against.

#### Other changes
 * #794 Fix defect with unpermitted params in advanced search
 * 2bc6184779a26070496e6f4caefa0cc9ba555d7b Remove broken support for delete links on arrays.
 * #851 upgrade paper_trail
 * Security fixes CVE-2019-16109, CVE-2019-16676, CVE-2019-5477, CVE-2019-16892
 * Dependency updates
 * Simple Form upgrades to use HTML5 and browser validations by default

#### Removed methods
`Lead.update_with_permissions` is removed, use user_ids and group_ids inside attributes instead and call lead.update_with_account_and_lead_counters

---------------------------------------------------------------------

### Important changes

#### Select2 for select boxes
This release replaces [Chozen](https://harvesthq.github.io/chosen/) with [Select2](https://select2.org/) consistently across the app.
This may break plugins which rely on Chozen. To fix any issues please
migrate to Select2 or add Chozen to your plugins.

#### Counter caches
To improve performance, a number of [counter caches](http://guides.rubyonrails.org/association_basics.html#options-for-belongs-to-counter-cache) have been added.

Users with large amounts of records may find certain [database migrations](https://github.com/fatfreecrm/fat_free_crm/blob/master/db/migrate/20180102075234_add_account_counter_caches.rb) taking a large amount of time, as each record is cached upfront.
