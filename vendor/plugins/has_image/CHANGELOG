  * Fix a critical problem with image updates breaking when used together with
    Rails' partial updates feature (now "on" by default). Thanks to Juan
    Schwindt <juan@schwindt.org> for the report.
  * Replaced a raw SQL call with update_all.

2008-10-22 Gerrit Keiser and Tricycle Developments
  * Added option to not delete images on destroy
  * Made thumbnail name separator configurable
  * Added height/width methods to storage
  * Allowed regenerating only one thumbnail size
  * Made has_image column configurable
  * Added some compatibility with attachment_fu
  * General refactorings and overall code improvement

2008-10-22 Norman Clarke <norman@randomba.org>
  * Documentation improvements and minor code cleanups.

2008-10-09 Dima Sabanin <sdmitry@gmail.com>
  * Fixed display of images with special symbols in the name,
    like '2777-nipple-+-apple-napple.jpg'. + is reserved by HTTP.
    Now escaping filenames before giving them back in #public_path()

2008-09-10 Norman Clarke <norman@randomba.org>
  * Fixed images not being converted to target format.
  
2008-08-29 Norman Clarke <norman@randomba.org>
  * Fixed bad call to has_image_file
  
2008-08-28 Norman Clarke <norman@randomba.org>
  * Added ability to regenerate a model's thumbnails.
  * Changed a few methods in storage to accept the model rather than the id.
    This makes storage more hackable as regards generating paths and file names.
  * Added "has_image_id" method to model instance methods to facilitate
    grouping the images under a directory structure based on a related model's
    ids.
  * Made the generated file name simply by the image object's id - this
    is better adherance to the principle of least surprise.

2008-08-25 Norman Clarke <norman@randomba.org>
  * Fixed bad call to resize_to in view helper.

2008-08-19 Norman Clarke <norman@randomba.org>
  * Made storage work more correctly with tempfiles.
  
2008-08-18 Norman Clarke <norman@randomba.org>
  * Fixed ability to set the path for storing image files.

2008-08-1 Adrian Mugnolo <adrian@randomba.org>
  * Improved partitioned path handling to avoid collisions when the id is
    very high, which can happen if you use db:fixtures:load.

2008-08-1 Norman Clarke <norman@randomba.org>
  * Fixed a bug where overwriting a previous image triggered callbacks more
    than once, causing errors.

2008-07-29 Norman Clarke <norman@randomba.org>

  * Downcased generated file names to avoid potential issues on
    case-insensitive filesystems.
  * Added "absolute path" method to model instances.
  * Made image deletion nullify the "has_image_file" field.
  * Added "has_image?" method to model instances.
  * Fixed ENONENT error with record update when there are no images yet.
  * Reverted thumbnail sorting feature - it's fast but makes terrible quality
    thumbnails. It's just not worth it.

2008-07-28 Norman Clarke <norman@randomba.org>

  * Added sorted thumbnail processing. This improves thumbnail generation
    speed by about 25% for 4.5 meg jpegs with 5 thumbnails.
  * Fixed broken resize for non-fixed-width thumbnails.
  * Added check for bad geometry strings.
  * Added dependencies and Rubyforge project to gemspec, updated docs.

2008-07-25 Norman Clarke <norman@randomba.org>

	* First public release.
