Description:
    The rspec_plugin generator creates stubs for a new plugin.

    The generator takes a plugin name as its argument.  The plugin name may be
    given in CamelCase or under_score and should not be suffixed with 'Plugin'.

    The generator creates a plugin directory in vendor/plugins that includes
    both init.rb and README.rdoc files as well as lib, task, and spec directories.
    
    You can also set up a database connection that's independent from the main
    app using --with-database

    It's also possible to generate stub files for a generator to go with the
    plugin by using --with-generator

Example:
    ./script/generate rspec_plugin BrowserFilters

    This will create:
        vendor/plugins/browser_filters/README.rdoc
        vendor/plugins/browser_filters/init.rb
        vendor/plugins/browser_filters/install.rb
        vendor/plugins/browser_filters/lib/browser_filters.rb
        vendor/plugins/browser_filters/spec/browser_filters_spec.rb
        vendor/plugins/browser_filters/tasks/browser_filters_tasks.rake
        
    --with-database will add:
        vendor/plugins/browser_filters/db/database.yml
        vendor/plugins/browser_filters/db/schema.rb

    --with-generator will add:
        vendor/plugins/browser_filters/generators/browser_filters/browser_filters_generator.rb
        vendor/plugins/browser_filters/generators/browser_filters/USAGE
