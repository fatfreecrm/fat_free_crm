 * Make your ActiveRecord model act as commentable.
 
 class Model < ActiveRecord::Base
 	acts_as_commentable
 end
 
 * Add a comment to a model instance
 
 model = Model.new
 comment = Comment.new
 comment.comment = 'Some comment'
 model.comments << comment

 # Following doesn't work/make sense to me. Leaving for historical sake -- Jack
 # * Each comment reference commentable object
 #
 # model = Model.find(1)
 # model.comments.get(0).commentable == model
